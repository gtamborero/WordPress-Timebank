== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The purpose of this timebank is to achieve an alternative and reliable transaction system between WP users.
We supose that the admins of the timebank will never win time (or money).
But, if the admins want to win time because of their tasks, they can create a “manager” user for the timebank.
This user have exactly the same characteristics as the other users.

Actually, we do not consider to apply certain percentage to transactions that could receive the “manager” user. (As normal banks does on money transactions)

Is not possible for an administrator to alter the balance of any user. Therefore, the administrator can manage transactions but never modify the amounts.

It’s important to understand that timebank is an transaction system but has no relation with the way your wordpress website promotes the use of timebank between users.
In the WordPress demo page we have created a system where WordPress users can publish offers and demands in the front end page; but it’s only an example; not the timebank system.
In the WordPress + BuddyPress demo you will find a better approach to a built-in timebank System because of buddyPress plugin system.
